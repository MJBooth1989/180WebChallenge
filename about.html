        <h3>This challenge is to make 180 websites <br> in the same amount of days!!</h3>
        <p>I do have a degree in Computing and yes things may be simple to start with and could create something fancy; but I believe by starting out small and building on what you have created so every day there will be extra functionality for each site i build so that it shows that from something simple to start with to an awesome creation at the end of it all that it takes dedication, patience and motivation to get to where you want to be.</p>
        <p>Going back to basics again will refresh what i already know and this is the key building block.</p>
        
        <p>The above will change at the end of the challenge.</p>
        
        <p>The next challenge will still use HTML and CSS but to build a landing page for a non-existent app which will build more upon Day 1's Challenge.</p>
